Hi and welcome to the repository of Machine Learning from Huzaifa Mahmood. In this repository you can find the codes and documentation for Machine Learning projects. First project uploaded is my analysis on house prices and their
lot areas. 
Libraries used:
1-PANDAS
2-NUMPY
3-SCIKIT LEARN
These libraries are used in order to manipulate and predict the house prices.

Model used:
1-LINEAR REGRESSION
As linear regression is easiest model in prediction of linear relations such as budget and sales, value and price, performance and salaries. In this example it is applied on only one variable Lot Area. 

Parameters:
1-Lot Area
The area of size is directly proportional to the price of that house. That is the reason for selecting this feature in this model.
2-House price
The house price is the most important factor when analyzing or predicting the behaviour of buyers in a narrow or a broad region. That's why this feature is selected.

Results:
1-The model worked just fine and predictions came right on!!

Improvements:
1-It still requires improvements in the areas of selecting better features such as neighbourhood, location and pool area etc.
2-Choosing multi variable linear regression model or other prediction models would give better results but would require some better mathematical skills as well. So look out for that!!

HAPPY CODING
